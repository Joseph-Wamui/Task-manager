## Conflict Resolution

During the development of the Task Manager Tool, a conflict arose when merging the `feature/delete-tasks` branch into the `main` branch. The conflict occurred in `add_task.py`, where both branches modified the same function. 

### Steps Taken to Resolve:
1. Identified conflicting changes in the `add_task` function.
2. Manually combined changes from both branches to support both adding and deleting tasks.
3. Removed conflict markers and saved the file.

The final implementation allows users to add and delete tasks, providing enhanced functionality to the tool.
